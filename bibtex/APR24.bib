abstract = {This report outlines the objectives, methodology, challenges, and results of the first Automated Program Repair Competition held at the APR Workshop 2024. The competition utilized Cerberus, a program repair framework, to evaluate the program repair tools using different repair configurations for each track in the competition. The competition was organized in three phases: first the participants integrated their tools with Cerberus, second the integrated tools were tested using public benchmarks and participants were able to fix any identified issues. In the last phase, the submitted tools and baseline comparison tools were evaluated against private benchmark programs.},
